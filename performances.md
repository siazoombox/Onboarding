### 🗒️ Quarterly Review Meeting Preparation Note  

To ensure a productive and meaningful discussion during the **Quarterly Performance Meeting**, all team members are required to:  
- Review their **previous Quarterly Review Report**, including the feedback and goals that were discussed.  
- Prepare and bring a **written summary of their self-achievements** and **improvements made toward previous goals**.  
- Be ready to discuss their progress, learnings, and areas where further support may be needed.  

If any team member arrives **unprepared**, has **not reviewed** the previous report and goals, or fails to provide their **written self-assessment**, the meeting will be **postponed to the following month**.  
This policy ensures that review sessions remain valuable, focused, and action-oriented.

### ⚠️ Performance Improvement Steps  

1. **⚠️ 1st Warning**: If performance scores remain below the targeted benchmarks for an extended period, despite support and discussions, a formal warning is issued. This serves as an opportunity to identify challenges and create a plan for improvement.  
2. **⏳ 2nd and Last Warning**: If there’s no significant improvement after the first warning, a final warning is issued. This step emphasizes the urgency of taking corrective actions.  
3. **❌ Termination**: Applied as a last resort if performance doesn't improve after the final warning.  

**Note:** We do not issue warnings if we see consistent, even slight, improvements toward the required benchmarks. We understand that growth takes time, and our aim is to support you in achieving your best.
If you ever feel unclear about your performance or need additional guidance, please don’t hesitate to reach out us in your HR channel. Our goal is to foster a culture of growth and collaboration, and your success is integral to that.
Let’s continue working together to achieve excellence!
