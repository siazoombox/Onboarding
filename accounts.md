## Email Accounts (Gmail)

At **Sia Zoombox**, we do **not** provision company-hosted webmail accounts.

Instead, each team member should create or use a **dedicated Gmail account** for work (separate from personal email) and share the address with the admin for access provisioning in tools.

**Recommended format**
- `firstname.lastname.zoombox@gmail.com` (preferred), or
- `firstname.lastname.work@gmail.com`

### Security requirements
- Enable **2‑Step Verification (2FA)**.
- Use a **password manager** and unique password.
- Keep recovery email/phone up to date.

### What this work Gmail is used for
- GitHub access
- Project management tools
- Communication tools (e.g., Slack/Discord)
- Documentation access

> Note: If a client requires a specific email pattern, document the exception in the project’s onboarding notes.
